# cyclic-learning-rate-schedules

This small repository contains data and notebooks for experiments with cyclic learning rate schedules from the workshop paper [``Fast Benchmarking of Accuracy vs. Training Time with Cyclic Learning Rates''](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00832) (Portes et al. 2022).

Data was collected using the MosaicML Composer library for PyTorch, and all experiments were run on the Mosaic Cloud.
